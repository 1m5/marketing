									<p class="style1">Most large organizations (e.g. tech giants, large corporations, banks, governments)
										track, persist, and use our behavior patterns for their gains without our consent and censor our
										communications for their benefit, sometimes in the name of the 'public good'.</p>
									<p class="style1">Decentralized applications (dapps) like 'public' blockchains and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
										are helping to wrestle some control from these large heavily centralized censoring organizations
										although many do not ensure privacy to/from their dapps.</p>
									<p class="style1">Smart phones, our primary means of global communication and
										collaboration, are weak in maintaining our anonymity and privacy - critical
										to ensuring individual freedom.</p>
									<p class="style1">What's needed is a decentralized application platform that ensures
										all communications can be maintained private, are ensured of getting to their destination
										regardless of who is attempting censorship, identities are under our own control,
										and we can share only what we specifically allow maintaining our privacy while
										supporting the ability to be transparent in our relationships.
									</p>
									<p class="style1">
										1M5 is a secure open-source decentralized
										peer-to-peer application platform with end-to-end encryption and anonymity as a base layer for
										creating easy to build and use secure decentralized peer-to-peer applications
										requiring no server connections that can be used around the world by any person
										looking to protect their communications and personal data from unjust intrusion,
										interception, monitoring, and censorship to ensure our natural rights to freedom of speech, expression,

									<p>
										The primary threats to freedom of speech/expression/assembly/association are governments but other
										entities commonly engage in it such as corporate based media. 1M5 dynamically works
										to maintain uncensored communications for applications using it by maneuvering against blocks
										and attacks on the internet and direct mesh networks. This maneuvering experiences varying
										levels of situational conditions called MANCON.
									</p>
									<p>
										MANCON is similar to the United States Armed Force's DEFCON. It is an alert state
										signalling the maneuvering required to achieve the mission. It can change
										at any time in response to new conditions arising.
										The base MANCON for a claimed jurisdiction is largely based on the

										<li>2 = Difficult Situation</li>
										<li>1 = Very Serious Situation</li>

												<h2>Application Features</h2>
												<p class="byline">
													1M5 provides the avoidance of censorship by providing intelligent routing
													across a number of peer-to-peer anonymity networks while making integration
													with these networks much easier for developers.
													It accomplishes this by providing an application infrastructure to build on
													based on a Micro-Services Architecture (SOA) for service integration
													and a Staged Event-Driven Architecture (SEDA) for asynchronous message routing.
													A number of common internal services are provided by the platform in addition
													to supporting pluggable services from service providers.

										With 1M5 integrated into your applications, your anonymity and privacy appear to be finally
										under your control, no longer being under mass unethical surveillance by unchecked governments and large
										corporations. Until you find out the operating system can bypass application security.
										Picking an Operating System for 1M5 and other applications to run in is crucial.
										Closed source operating systems like Windows and Macintosh just don't cut it.
										It's impossible to know what's in the source code as the code is maintained as a secret and legal non-disclosure
										agreements are used to enforce secrecy gagging those few with the knowledge.
										Linux is by far the winner here and there are many flavors.
										But when looking at a secure open source operating system,
										we want to know there is a group actively working to constantly combat attackers.
									</p>
									<p>
										So then you might wonder, 'does the rabbit hole go deeper'?
										Yes, the whole stack from physical metal up is under attack by
										governments, corporations, and thieves worldwide. And there's no one in our corner.
										Until you meet <a href="https://puri.sm/" target="_blank">Purism</a>.
										Purism is <a href="https://puri.sm/learn/freedom-roadmap/" target="_blank">working down the stack</a>
										with hardware and driver manufacturers to claw back our right to privacy.
										We recommend buying all of your general-purpose laptops and phones from this organization.
									</p>
									<p>
										Longer-term, we are working towards building hardware-specific devices that will not be general-purpose,
										but will focus purely on ensuring secure communications. Their hardware and software stack
										will be designed and implemented for specific tasks such as secure communications not
										supporting installation of additional software to minimize potential unsafe code
										getting introduced yet will remain completely open source (hardware & software) to be transparent in
										ensuring no back doors are added. We are looking at the Redox operating system as a safer alternative to Linux
										for these specialized devices. It is built with the Rust programming language which supports system level development
										yet manages memory without using garbage collection nor requiring programmers to manage it
										resulting in a much safer general purpose operating system. It also runs drivers in userspace
										vs the kernalspace better isolating misbehaving drivers.

									<h1>Contribute to 1M5</h1>
									<p>
										1M5 is an <a href="https://github.com/1m5" target="_blank">open source</a>
										project powered by volunteers, bounties, and donations. In the spirit of
										open source and censorship resistance, we have opted to create 1M5 without the
										demands or influence of investors nor governments. Each of us is involved in
										the project because we personally believe in it! This is not just another
										decentralized startup, this is a project aiming to be driven by the global
										community and serving the global community.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are a few ways you can help support 1M5’s development:

										<h2>Contribute to Development</h2>
										<p>
											If you’re reading this then you probably have the skills that would really
											help 1M5 build and grow. We are constantly looking for skilled volunteers
											who can help us with the development of 1M5 and spread the word to the wider
											decentralization community. If you wish to communicate anonymously, we have
											a 1M5 channel on I2P's IRC. Leave a message and we will get back to you ASAP.
											As for as email goes, we prefer communications using I2P first and protonmail.com
											second.
										</p>
										<p>
											We have two tracks: Business Development and Software Development. Business
											development includes donation management, public relations, marketing, product management, blogging,
											graphic design, and web site development. Software development includes architecture,
											technology research, integration, cryptology, software engineering, and programming.
											People usually belong to either group but may belong to both, especially when
											there are few people involved.
										</p>
										<p>
											For business development, 1M5 needs business development leads for each solution under the 1M5 banner.
											Currently this is only Dgramz but will grow as there are many needs in the pipeline.
										</p>
										<p>
											For software development, 1M5 needs software development leads for each component on GitHub. Current
											priorities are Tor and 1DM (direct mesh network). This can and will likely change with
											solution prioritization. Most components are in Java, so if you have experience with
											Java and interested in supporting the 1M5 mission, please <a href="#contact">contact us below</a>
											and let us know!

										<h2>Contribute to Bounties</h2>
										<p>
											We set up bounties for development tasks as funds come in. You can either
											support an existing bounty by donating to the bounty address or set up your
											own bounty for a feature you would love to see get implemented in 1M5.
										</p>

										<h2>Contribute to Donations</h2>
										<p>
											By donating Bitcoin to our donation wallet, you will be helping 1M5 pay for
											our direct costs like web hosting, domain names, outsourced work, bounties, and so on.
											So if you support this project and are in a position to help us out then that would be wonderful.
											If you wish to support us anonymously, we recommend using
											<a href="https://bisq.network" target="_blank">Bisq</a> as it uses Tor
											and using a source of Bitcoin that doesn't have your identity attached to it.
