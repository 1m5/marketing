									<p class="style2">Free Speech, Expression, Assembly, Association for All Humanity</p>
									<p class="style1">1M5 is at its core a mission to ensure free speech, expression, association, and assembly.</p>
									<p class="style1">When the Berlin wall was opened in November 1989, expectations of
										a more open human society sprang forward. Yet several decades later we are
										experiencing digital walls being raised by governments and large corporations
										in the name of protection. These walls promote segregation and censorship of
										information having a negative effect on creativity, innovative technology,
										and freedom of speech, expression, association, and assembly.</p>
									<p class="style1">Freedom of Speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual
										or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation,
										censorship, or sanction. The term "freedom of expression" is sometimes used synonymously
										but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.</p>
									<p class="style1">Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication,
										or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable,
										harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or "inconvenient" as determined by
										government authorities or by community consensus.</p>
									<p class="style1">Constraining the free flow of information between people is a
										direct threat to our freedom and censorship of communications on-line is growing world-wide.</p>
									<p class="style1">On-line communications are censored at the point of entrance by
										Internet Service Providers (ISP). They act as gateways to the internet providing
										governments control over speech by having the ability to restrict usage and track
										people's usage via their leased IP addresses. In order to make tracking usage much
										more difficult, tools have come out that provide techniques called onion-/garlic-routing
										where the source and destinations of internet routes can not be determined without
										breaking encryption, a very expensive feat, sometimes impossible today when considering the encryption algorithms used.</p>
									<p class="style1">Many governments are using IP (Internet Protocol) geo-fencing
										(e.g. China’s Great Firewall) to isolate people from global information and
										mass surveillance (e.g. US’ NSA Prism and China’s Social Credit System) to
										increase self-censorship. These systems are now being replicated by many other
										governments world-wide and governments are working together to oppress the masses
										globally (e.g. Five/Fourteen Eyes).</p>
									<p class="style1">Privacy, the bedrock of freedom, is being lost at an alarming
										rate and few know how to maintain it today. Most large organizations
										(e.g. tech giants, the banking industry, governments) track, persist,
										and use our behavior for their profit not ours. Whistleblowers, the abused,
										visible minorities, and a myriad of other people could be emboldened by anonymity
										to speak out in a manner that would otherwise be unavailable if they were forced
										to identify themselves. Decentralized applications like Bitcoin are helping to
										wrestle some control from centralized organizations although they are difficult
										to maintain anonymity at the network layer. Smartphones, our primary means of
										global communication and collaboration, are weak in maintaining our anonymity
										and privacy - critical to ensuring individual freedom.</p>
									<p class="style1">Two primary tools today that support this are Tor and I2P.
										Tor provides a browser that makes it easier to use while I2P is much less known.
										Both are complementary in that Tor was designed for browsing today's current
										web sites anonymously. I2P was designed for peer-to-peer communications within I2P.
										Neither have good APIs for developers to embed in their products making uptake slow for many applications.</p>
									<p class="style1">A third tool on the horizon is one that completely circumvents
										ISPs by not using them. They're called direct wireless ad-hoc networks and they
										can communicate directly device-to-device (no intermediate routers) using technologies such as WiFi Direct.
										Firechat is an example used during the 2014 Hong Kong protests after the Chinese
										government threatened to shutdown the internet in that area. Mesh solutions are
										popping up that seek to improve on earlier designs but typically do not include
										ensuring anonymity.</p>
									<p class="style1">Even getting these technologies in wide use doesn't solve the
										problem of online censorship. People in governments, corporations, and other
										thieves are constantly finding ways to circumvent these technologies to censor
										and steal information. People in goverment are creating laws in an attempt to threaten people
										into opening up the software often resulting in breaking their own laws.
										You become a felon either way!</p>
									<p class="style1">Tech-savvy people can always find a way to bypass censorship
										and maintain privacy, but the overwhelming majority can not thus preventing a
										critical mass to make positive change on a political level globally. What’s
										needed is to bring censorship resistance and data privacy to this overwhelming
										majority so that all people are not only able to become free, but that they can remain so.</p>
									<p class="style2">What's our core beliefs that drive us?</p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>EVERYONE, including criminals and unethical people, have a natural right to Freedom of Speech, Expression, Association, and Assembly</strong></p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>All relationships must be voluntary</strong></p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>Privacy is the bedrock of freedom - we should be able to communicate as we please privately - anonymity as a base</strong></p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>Transparency in code/governance</strong></p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>We own our data and should be the ones that profit from it</strong></p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>Self-sovereign identity – people must establish and maintain their own identities, not by 3rd parties</strong></p>
									<p class="style1"><strong>Self-sovereign money – people must be their own bank indebted to no one with the keys to their money</strong></p>

									<p>
										The primary threats to freedom of speech/expression/assembly/association are governments but other
										entities commonly engage in it such as corporate based media. 1M5 dynamically works
										to maintain uncensored communications for applications using it by maneuvering against blocks
										and attacks on the internet and direct mesh networks. This maneuvering experiences varying
										levels of situational conditions called MANCON.
									</p>
									<p>
										MANCON is similar to the United States Armed Force's DEFCON. It is an alert state
										signalling the maneuvering required to achieve the mission. It can change
										at any time in response to new conditions arising.
										The base MANCON for a claimed jurisdiction is largely based on the
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index" target="_blank">Press Freedom Index</a>.

										<li>5 = Good Situation</li>
										<li>4 = Satisfactory Situation</li>
										<li>3 = Noticeable Problems</li>
										<li>2 = Difficult Situation</li>
										<li>1 = Very Serious Situation</li>
									</ul>

												<h2>Application Features</h2>
												<p class="byline">
													1M5 provides the avoidance of censorship by providing intelligent routing
													across a number of peer-to-peer anonymity networks while making integration
													with these networks much easier for developers.
													It accomplishes this by providing an application infrastructure to build on
													based on a Micro-Services Architecture (SOA) for service integration
													and a Staged Event-Driven Architecture (SEDA) for asynchronous message routing.
													A number of common internal services are provided by the platform in addition
													to supporting pluggable services from service providers.

										With 1M5 integrated into your applications, your anonymity and privacy appear to be finally
										under your control, no longer being under mass unethical surveillance by unchecked governments and large
										corporations. Until you find out the operating system can bypass application security.
										Picking an Operating System for 1M5 and other applications to run in is crucial.
										Closed source operating systems like Windows and Macintosh just don't cut it.
										It's impossible to know what's in the source code as the code is maintained as a secret and legal non-disclosure
										agreements are used to enforce secrecy gagging those few with the knowledge.
										Linux is by far the winner here and there are many flavors.
										But when looking at a secure open source operating system,
										we want to know there is a group actively working to constantly combat attackers.
										So then you might wonder, 'does the rabbit hole go deeper'?
										Yes, the whole stack from physical metal up is under attack by
										governments, corporations, and thieves worldwide. And there's no one in our corner.

									<h1>Contribute to 1M5</h1>
									<p>
										1M5 is an <a href="https://github.com/1m5" target="_blank">open source</a>
										project powered by volunteers, bounties, and donations. In the spirit of
										open source and censorship resistance, we have opted to create 1M5 without the
										demands or influence of investors nor governments. Each of us is involved in
										the project because we personally believe in it! This is not just another
										decentralized startup, this is a project aiming to be driven by the global
										community and serving the global community.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are a few ways you can help support 1M5:

										<h2>Development</h2>
										<p>
											If you’re reading this then you probably have the skills that would really
											help 1M5 build and grow. We are constantly looking for skilled volunteers
											who can help us with the development of 1M5 and spread the word to the wider
											decentralization community. If you wish to communicate anonymously, we have
											a 1M5 channel on I2P's IRC. Leave a message and we will get back to you ASAP.
											As for as email goes, we prefer communications using I2P first and protonmail.com
											second.
										</p>
										<p>
											We have two tracks: Administrative and Development. Administrative includes
											donation management, public relations, marketing, product management, blogging,
											graphic design, and web site development. Development includes architecture,
											technology research, integration, cryptology, software engineering, and programming.
											People usually belong to either group but may belong to both, especially when
											there are few people involved.
										</p>
										<p>
											For development, 1M5 needs development leads for each component on GitHub. Current
											priorities are Tor and 1DM (direct mesh network). This can and will likely change with
											solution prioritization. Most components are in Java, so if you have experience with
											Java and interested in supporting the 1M5 mission, please <a href="#footer">contact us below</a>
											and let us know!

										<h2>Bounties</h2>
										<p>
											We set up bounties for development tasks as funds come in. You can either
											support an existing bounty by donating to the bounty address or set up your
											own bounty for a feature you would love to see get implemented in 1M5.
										</p>
										<p>
											Please check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/1m5">GitHub issues</a> for more information.

										<h2>Donations</h2>
										<p>
											By donating Bitcoin to our donation wallet, you will be helping 1M5 pay for
											our direct costs like web hosting, domain names, outsourced work, bounties, and so on.
											So if you support this project and are in a position to help us out then that would be wonderful.
											If you wish to support us anonymously, we recommend using
											<a href="https://bisq.network" target="_blank">Bisq</a> as it uses Tor
											and using a source of Bitcoin that doesn't have your identity attached to it.
										</p>

											Note: Donations to 1M5 are not tax deductible as we are not formally registered
											in any jurisdiction.

											Please don’t hesitate to <a href="#footer">get in touch</a> if you can
											think of other ways you can help with the 1M5 project.
