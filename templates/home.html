										With 1M5 integrated into your applications, your anonymity and privacy appear to be finally
										under your control, no longer being under mass unethical surveillance by unchecked governments and large
										corporations. Until you find out the operating system can bypass application security.
										Picking an Operating System for 1M5 and other applications to run in is crucial.
										Closed source operating systems like Windows and Macintosh just don't cut it.
										It's impossible to know what's in the source code as the code is maintained as a secret and legal non-disclosure
										agreements are used to enforce secrecy gagging those few with the knowledge.
										Linux is by far the winner here and there are many flavors.
										But when looking at a secure open source operating system,
										we want to know there is a group actively working to constantly combat attackers.
									</p>
									<p>
										So then you might wonder, 'does the rabbit hole go deeper'?
										Yes, the whole stack from physical metal up is under attack by
										governments, corporations, and thieves worldwide. And there's no one in our corner.
										Until you meet <a href="https://puri.sm/" target="_blank">Purism</a>.
										Purism is <a href="https://puri.sm/learn/freedom-roadmap/" target="_blank">working down the stack</a>
										with hardware and driver manufacturers to claw back our right to privacy.
										We recommend buying all of your general-purpose laptops and phones from this organization.
									</p>
									<p>
										Longer-term, we are working towards building hardware-specific devices that will not be general-purpose,
										but will focus purely on ensuring secure communications. Their hardware and software stack
										will be designed and implemented for specific tasks such as secure communications not
										supporting installation of additional software to minimize potential unsafe code
										getting introduced yet will remain completely open source (hardware & software) to be transparent in
										ensuring no back doors are added. We are looking at the Redox operating system as a safer alternative to Linux
										for these specialized devices. It is built with the Rust programming language which supports system level development
										yet manages memory without using garbage collection nor requiring programmers to manage it
										resulting in a much safer general purpose operating system. It also runs drivers in userspace
										vs the kernalspace better isolating misbehaving drivers.

										<h2>Contribute to Donations</h2>
										<p>
											By donating Bitcoin to our donation wallet, you will be helping 1M5 pay for
											our direct costs like web hosting, domain names, outsourced work, bounties, and so on.
											So if you support this project and are in a position to help us out then that would be wonderful.
											If you wish to support us anonymously, we recommend using
											<a href="https://bisq.network" target="_blank">Bisq</a> as it uses Tor
											and using a source of Bitcoin that doesn't have your identity attached to it.

										</p>
										<p>
											Note: Donations to 1M5 are not tax deductible as we are not formally registered
											in any jurisdiction. We do not accept donations in Altcoins at this point in time.
											We would be really grateful if you converted them to Bitcoin and donated them that way though!
										</p>
										<p>
											Please don’t hesitate to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> if you can
											think of other ways you can help with the 1M5 project.
